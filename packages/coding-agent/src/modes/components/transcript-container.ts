/**
 * Transcript container that freezes the rendered output of every block except
 * the bottom-most (live) one on terminals where committed native scrollback is
 * immutable.
 *
 * On ED3-risk terminals with an unobservable viewport (ghostty/kitty/iTerm2/…)
 * the renderer cannot clear saved lines (`\x1b[3J` may yank a reader) or query
 * whether the user has scrolled, so any block that re-lays-out *after* it has
 * scrolled past the viewport leaves a stale duplicate above the live region
 * (a finalized assistant message re-wrapping, a tool preview collapsing to its
 * compact result, a late async tool completion). The renderer's only safe move
 * for such an offscreen edit is to not repaint — which is correct only if the
 * committed region never changes underneath it.
 *
 * This container provides that guarantee: a block's render is snapshotted while
 * it is the live (bottom-most) block, and once a newer block is appended it
 * replays the snapshot instead of recomputing. Mutations after a block leaves
 * live are intentionally deferred until the next checkpoint {@link thaw} (prompt
 * submit → native-scrollback rebuild), where the whole transcript is replayed
 * and any drift reconciles safely. On terminals that can rebuild history this
 * freezing is unnecessary, so it renders every block live for full fidelity.
